I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* I finished task3, task5, task9 and part of task10, task11.

* Among them, I am proud of the action which I transform all the masks to a matrix and
  rotate and reverse them with the method for matrix. Also, I provide a model for each
  mask and get the position of mask by select number from a matrix.

* At the same time, I am proud of finding all the solutions recursively and provide a
  a helper function for hint (task10). In the end, the startPoints are generated by
  the function I write.

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of <How to write tests> came from a discussion with Shiqin Huo u5949730
* The idea of <How to implement task 9> came from a discussion with Xiangyi Luo u6162693

* The code in class <SelectionSorter.java> is based on a solution we found in BIG JAVA: Early Objects written by CAY HORSTMANN
* The code in class <GetCoordinateTest> uses an idea suggested by comp1110.lectures.S03
* The code in class <RotateAndReverseTest> uses an idea suggested by comp1110.lectures.S03
