I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* My main works are task4 and task6, 
  in addition, I create some tool classes which store encoding of pieces and board.

* Some methods such as usedPos and cannotUse in class Pieces and encoding board positions
  in class Alphabet are really helpful
  when I check the what positions are available at next move.
  
* The notObstruct method (the core part of task6) which can check obstruction between pieces helps a lot. 
  The validOrder method store candidates in HashMap properly, which reduces the time cost when reorder
  the solutions.

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of <How to write tests> came from a discussion with Shiqin Huo u5949730 and Wenjun Yang u6251843

* The code in class <Alphabet> is based on comp1110 assignment 1 class <Board>
* The code in class <Pieces> uses an idea suggested by comp1110.lectures class <Boggle>
* The code for task 6 uses an idea suggested by online resource(https://www.javatpoint.com/recursion-in-java)
